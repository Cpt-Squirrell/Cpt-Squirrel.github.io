                    A novice programmer amongst other things from Sweden. Welcome to my portfolio.
                </h5>
                <p>
                    My name is Philip Bromander. I live in Sweden and is currently (as of 2024) studying a bachelor of innovative programming at Link√∂ping University.
                    I love working with computers and I have been playing video games since I was seven years old or so.
                    My first programming language was Lua when I was very young and I used it for hobby projects up until I started using C#.
                    However, the language I have used the most is C and C++. I started working with C++ during my first year of secondary school.
                    I have deep interest in most things military which has been fueled by a lot of war games and simulations.
                    I am also interested in working with computer graphics in the future. There is something intriguing with constructing vast digital scapes.
                    Outside of working with computers I like to be hands-on with mechanical things, such as working on the car whenever I can.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Here I host a few of my projects, those that are worth actually taking a look at.
                    I'm a handy person who likes to tinker with both theoretical and practical problems and
                    programming is just one out of many hobbies. When it comes to programming I work primarily in C++.
                    I have worked with many languages so far such as Lua, C#, C and C++, Ruby, Python, SQF, PHP, SQL, and recently been testing some Zig.
                    And then of course I have worked with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to create this wonderful portfolio. Among there I have also tested SCSS.
                    In other web-dev courses I have also worked with databases, interacting with PHP and SQL.
                    In an earlier school I also got somewhat familiar with Microsoft Windows Server 2012 R2.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The area in programming that interest me the most is probably computer graphics.
                    The background of this portfolio was made by me from scratch in JavaScript using canvas elements and render buffers.
                    <noscript>Sadly, it would appear that the background has failed to load.</noscript> It went through multiple
                    iterations from random lines spanning the sides making a criss-cross pattern to now bubbles
                    that interact with each other. Fun fact: there is actually a very small and obscure bug with
                    the current implementation on how bubbles interact with each other. Can you spot it?
                    On the topic of 3D graphics, a dream for me would be creating a game engine or render engine
                    of some sorts; perhaps to pursue the goal of creating a video game?
                </p>
                <p>
                    Other than programming I like to work with 3D art. In particular hard-surface modelling - though I would like get better at organic modelling too -
                    and I use Blender for all my 3D needs. I like practical work too and 3D printing ties in well with the hobby of 3D modelling.
                    Worth mentioning as well is my pride in my writing excellence.
                    <em>Punctuation, to be precise.</em> Even in SMS' or in-game text chats I will still be typing
                    out my full stops and apostraphes when others would simply forgo any and all punctuation;
                    it's muscle memory at this point.

                            This portfolio was originally made for a web-dev course and became well overdue.
                            It features a tiny autobiography about myself and a few projects that I have
                            worked on and are worthwhile sharing. It features seemingly well working responsive
                            layout and a nice live background created from scratch in JavaScript and Canvas elements.
                            There is not much to say about this Portfolio, it's really "what you see is what you get".

                                Backerup is my project for the finishing course during school.
                                It's a very simple backup program which is designed to be easily
                                accessed entirely through CLI.
                            </div>
                        </a>
                    </div>
                    <dd class="project-description">
                        <p>
                            In essence, Backerup is like most other back up utilities out there except
                            due to time constrains I could not add all features I wanted. This project
                            may or may not be revisited to be finalised at a later date. With that said,
                            the program is entirely usable in its current state though safety of data can
                            not be guarenteed. The program is written in C++ and uses the library TinyXML2
                            for XML data handling and other than this library the project is all homebrewed
                            code.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The purpose of the project was to make up the bulk of my final assignment
                            in school. I wrote an essay (in Swedish) together with the development of the
                            program which detailed the purpose, design, theory, execution, and the
                            final product. The work was examined and graded. But the idea of the project was
                            not only for a school project. The original idea goes back a few years when
                            I was simply brainstorming things to do. The idea of making a general purpose
                            backup utility sprung in to mind which led to the first actual plannings of
                            the project being written. After a short while the project was shelved only
                            to be revitalized during the school project.

                                <h3>Conway's Game of Life <u style="float: right;">Find on GitHub</u></h3>
                                I made a Conway's Game of Life in C# during a programming course.
                                It broke a few times and currently there does not exist a fully functional version.
                            </div>
                        </a>
                    </div>
                    <dd class="project-description">
                        <p>
                            My Conways Game of Life was made in C# during my second year in Gymnasium in a
                            programming course and <em>it once upon a time did work</em> but due to devilish optimisation
                            I accidentally broke the program right before hand-in. It has been broken ever since but I will
                            eventually return to the project and finish the optimised version, or so it the plan anyways.
                            The linked GitHub page is the "Reborn" version - that would be the most up to date version -
                            but the original is still up and public on my GitHub profile.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Whilst I do not have any working executable showing a working Conways game, I do have
                            a few backed up executables from the development showing a few really cool looking
                            patterns produced by various bugs (that were eventually ironed out). Here are a few of
                            them in GIF form:
                            <table>
                                <tr>
                                    <td><img src="Conway_50ms.gif" style="max-block-size: 10em;"></td>
                                    <td><img src="Conway_100ms.gif" style="max-block-size: 10em;"></td>
                                    <td><img src="Conway_Maze.gif" style="max-block-size: 10em;"></td>
                                </tr>
                            </table>
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The program was made in MonoGame and, even though I had no prior experience
                            with MonoGame or the alikes, the development process was surprisingly very straightforward.
                        </p>
